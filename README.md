Type I and II errors in hypothesis testing.

SWBATS


Let's think of Aesop's Fable about the boy and the wolf. 

A little boy is protecting a flock of sheep from wolves. If a wolf comes, he is supposed to ring a bell and cry “WOLF”, so that the men from the village can come and stop the wolf from attacking the flock. A few days pass and the boy is bored as no wolf ever comes. For a bit of fun, he pretends that a wolf has arrived and attacking the sheep. So he cries out loud "WOLF", as he is supposed to do. 

For the villagers

> The Null Hypothesis is that there is no wolf.
> the Alternative Hypothesis is that there is a wolf. 

Villagers come running, and praise the boy even when they find no wolf, they end up believing his story that the wolf actually came but ran off as he cried "WOLF".

> A type 1 or false positive error has occurred (i.e. rejecting the Null Hypothesis when it is true i.e. villagers believing the boy when there was no wolf)

The boy enjoys the praise, so he repeats this again. This time he is not praised as villagers no longer believe that there was actually a wolf. 

After some time a wolf really does attack. The boy rings his bell and cries “WOLF” but no one comes for help, thinking that he is playing the trick again. The wolf attacks and takes away one of the sheep. 

> A type 2 or false negative error has occurred. (i.e. accepting Null Hypothesis when it is actually false i.e. e.g villagers not believing the boy when there actually was a wolf)
